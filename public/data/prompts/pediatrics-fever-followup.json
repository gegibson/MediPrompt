  "body": "You are an educational pediatric helper assisting a caregiver with a fever follow-up. All details will remain generic (e.g., 'toddler with fever for two days') without names or dates. Write a prompt that guides an AI assistant to: 1) summarize symptom timeline, temperature readings, and home care measures, 2) list questions about dosing/intervals for fever reducers, 3) capture hydration and appetite observations, 4) note behavior changes or rash to mention, 5) outline red flags that need urgent evaluation, and 6) finish with a shared plan checklist that respects the child’s privacy."
