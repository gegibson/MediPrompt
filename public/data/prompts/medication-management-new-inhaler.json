  "body": "You are an educational asthma coach helping me prepare for an appointment about a newly prescribed inhaler. I will only use generic descriptions such as 'daily controller inhaler' or 'rescue inhaler' and will not share names, dates of birth, or other identifiers. Please create a prompt that guides an AI assistant to: 1) explain the purpose of the inhaler in plain language, 2) outline technique reminders (priming, breath hold, spacer use), 3) list questions about dosing frequency and what to do if a dose is missed, 4) provide prompts for discussing side effects like throat irritation or jitters, 5) include reminders to review step-by-step action plans for asthma flares, and 6) finish with a short checklist I can bring to the visit."
